/- End-to-end test: the projection functions of a NESTED structure
   (`kids : List Tree`) and of a directly RECURSIVE one (`Stream'.tail :
   Unit → Stream'`), rewritten to recursor applications by the frontend
   (`ConLeche/Frontend/ProjRec.lean`, 2026-09-06; the mutual twin is
   `mutual_struct_proj.lean`).

   `Tree.rec` carries two motives (the tree's and the auxiliary one
   over `List Tree`) and four minors (`node`, then `List.nil`/`List.cons`
   at the container); `Tree.label`/`Tree.kids` become
   `Tree.rec (motive_1 := fun _ => F_i) (motive_2 := fun _ => PUnit)
   … self`, and the constructor minor ignores the auxiliary inductive
   hypothesis.  `Stream'` is a reflexive recursive structure with no
   base case (uninhabited), so its projections are checked but never
   reduced.  `sum` is the nested-recursion consumer whose
   equation-compiler output reads `Tree.kids` inside `brecOn`, and the
   `rfl`s force iota through the rewritten projections. -/
