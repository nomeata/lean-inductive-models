--#export MC.self

/- End-to-end fixture (task #208; inductive audit #206, A4 / crack C4,
   the SORT variant): a mutual block whose members' RESULT SORTS are
   definitionally but not syntactically equal — `MC : Sort (max u v)`,
   `MD : Sort (max v u)`.  Official compares them with `is_equivalent`
   (`check_inductive_types`, inductive.cpp:250) and accepts the block and
   its recursors.

   con-leche's in-process modeller compares them with `==`
   (Frontend/InModel/Mutual.lean:164, Nested.lean:351) and declines:
   "member MD: parameter telescope or sort differs from MC's".  The
   preprocessor's native predicate checks only counts, so the block stays
   in-process and the generator's decline is the run's — piped and raw.

   The parameter variant is ind_mutual_param_defeq.  Only the sort half
   of the probe is exported here: the probe file also carried an
   `id Type` mutual pair whose first member the v4.29.1 kernel rejects,
   which would have masked this verdict.

   official: 0.  con-leche at master 700a06ca: 2 piped, 2 raw (both modes).
   Probe of record: _tmp/indaudit/probes/P/MutualDefEq.lean.

   CLOSED by task #218: the modeller no longer compares the sorts; it
   builds the auxiliary family at the first member's `Sort (max u v)` and
   emits `MD._model : Sort (max v u) := aux tag.1`, whose definition
   check is official's `is_equivalent`.  (The block has a SMALL
   eliminator — a possibly-zero sort with two members — which exposed
   that the projection artifacts of a structure-like member assumed an
   elimination level; they are now emitted only under a large one.)
   con-leche: 0 (both modes).  The bad twin ind_mutual_sort_bad
   (`MD : Sort (max u 1)`, scripts/mk_mutual_bad.py) rejects there, as
   official does. -/

/-! The probe kit (task #206/#208): declarations the official kernel
accepts but Lean's *elaborator* refuses to write down are added with the
kernel type check skipped, so that they exist in the environment and
therefore in the export.  Inductive declarations still go through
`add_inductive`, so an inductive here is one the kernel really admits. -/
