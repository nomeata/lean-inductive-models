/-! Witness D15 (reduce_nat argument order): official `reduce_bin_nat_op`
whnf's the FIRST argument and bails when it is not a literal, never
touching the second; con-leche's `reduceNat` whnf's both before matching.
`o` is opaque so the first argument never becomes a literal; the second is
an expensive closed computation that only con-leche evaluates on this defeq. -/
