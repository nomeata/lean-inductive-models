/- End-to-end test: the **direct sum** install (task #175 sum-types) on
   an enumeration — three constructors, no fields, `Type`.

   Regenerate by exporting this module with the arena's lean4export
   (task #207: the stream is raw — not a single `_model` declaration
   in it).  Everything here goes through
   `checkSum`: the type former with no capability, the three
   constructors, the recursor with three minor premises and three
   rules.  The consumers exercise iota on every constructor (`rfl`
   through `Color.rec` and `Color.casesOn`), Lean's own auxiliaries on
   the block (`casesOn`, the `match` compiler's output), and a
   `Bool`-valued elimination (the exported `Bool` block goes direct as
   well). -/
